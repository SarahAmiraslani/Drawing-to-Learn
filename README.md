# Draw-to-learn-science

## Introduction

A project to study whether drawing is a useful strategy to learn about abstract scientific concepts. In two notebooks, I analyze data collected from 500 individuals who participated in one of two experiments on ths topic. Participants were randomly assigned to either study or copy an instructor-created drawing, complete a scaffolded drawing worksheet, or to draw on a blank sheet of paper while reading about an abstract concept or a physical system. We found evidence that drawing without guidance most effectively encourages retention but not transfer when the lesson is abstract. Drawing did not encourage retention or transfer when the lesson was on a physical system.

## Background

Researchers have studied whether drawing helps students learn the structure and function of physical systems. Although the results are mixed and not all find a benefit to drawing (Van Meter and Garner 2005), they generally find that the efficacy of drawing to learn depends on a few factors. These factors include the accuracy of the drawing, the prior knowledge of the learner, and the level of guidance provided during the drawing process (Fiorella & Zhang, 2018), where novices benefit from greater guidance (Van Meter, 2001). However, what if the accuracy of the learners’ drawings did not matter? We propose that when there is no correct way to represent the contents of a lesson in a drawing, it is less important that students draw exactly what an instructor would produce as these representations are arbitrary. This may mean that even without guidance, student-generated drawings may improve learning by more effectively capturing students’ thinking and prompting them to build visual representations that they find memorable.

## Research Questions

1. Is drawing an effective strategy when used to learn science?
2. Does the efficacy of drawing to learn depend on the contents of the lesson?
3. Is drawing a more useful tool when learning about abstract concepts compared to physical systems?

## Hypotheses

1. The efficacy of drawing to learn will depend on the contents of the lesson such that drawing will encourage meaningful learning only when the contents of the lesson cannot be represented as a physical system.
2. Meaningful learning will improve as students generate more of their own drawing (i.e., participants who draw will do better than those who complete a scaffolded worksheet, and those who complete a scaffolded worksheet will do better than those who copied the same worksheet, etc.)

- The purpose of Experiment 1 was to test whether greater illustration generativity would benefit retention and transfer of a passage about an abstract scientific phenomena. We predicted that retention and transfer performance would improve as participants generated more of their own illustration. If this were true, we would expect participants who studied a drawing provided to them to perform the worst on both measures of comprehension and for participants who drew their own illustration to perform the best.

`Experiment2.ipynb`

- The purpose of Experiment 2 was to replicate the finding that students benefit from guidance when drawing to learning about a physical system. We predicted that retention and transfer performance would be the highest in the complete condition because this is the condition in which the most guidance was provided during the drawing process. Moreover, we predicted that retention and transfer would be higher in the drawing condition compared to the copying and studying conditions because the act of producing a drawing from scratch is thought to improve memory. We did not expect significant differences between the copying and studying conditions.
